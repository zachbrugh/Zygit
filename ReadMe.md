Zygit is a python reimplimentation of Git, based on the wyag library which can be found at https://wyag.thb.lt. 

The guide for writting the wyag library was incomplete, missing the core Git functionality commit, status, and add. Zygit implements these, as well as some other commands shown in the guide.
